        <h2>Notice of Privacy Practices</h2>
        <h3>Effective Date: July 20, 2021</h3>
        <h4>
          THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED
          AND DISCLOSED, AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE
          REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Warby Parker takes the confidentiality of your health information very
          seriously. We are required by law to provide you with this Notice of
          Privacy Practices (“Notice”) and follow the terms of this Notice while
          it is in effect. This Notice is intended to cover Warby Parker Inc.,
          which does business as Warby Parker, as health care provider covered
          by HIPAA (“Warby Parker”), and its affiliate eye practices as health
          care providers covered by HIPAA (“We,” “Us,” or “Our”). Although these
          affiliate eye practices are separate corporations from Warby Parker,
          We may work together to provide you with Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Notice is a summary of your privacy rights, and your use of Our
          Services evidences your acceptance of the terms of this Notice.
          “Services” means any of the services Warby Parker or We offer,
          including eye exams, refraction testing through our Prescription Check
          mobile application and/or in-store service (collectively,
          “Prescription Check”), and the prescribing and dispensing of
          prescription eyeglasses. Warby Parker also operates the website
          warbyparker.com, the website myvisiondirectory.com, an e-commerce
          mobile application, and other related websites and mobile applications
          that contain links to this Notice. In this Notice, “health
          information”, “protected health information”, and “PHI” refer to
          individually identifiable health information that We obtain from you
          in connection with the Services. Individual information that We
          receive from you which is not covered by HIPAA is covered by Our Terms
          of Use and Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h3>1. Our use and Disclosure of PHI</h3>
        <p>
          Generally, We use and disclose your PHI for the normal business
          activities that fall in the categories of treatment, payment, and
          healthcare operations, in accordance with the Health Insurance
          Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). Below are a few
          examples of those activities (but note that not every use or
          disclosure that falls within each category is included!).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>
            Treatment. Treatment includes providing, coordinating, and managing
            your care. We keep record of the PHI you provide to us in the course
            of using the Services. This record may include the results of your
            eye exam, information We receive in connection with your use of
            Prescription Check, your prescription information, the prescription
            products that you purchase, information related to your vision
            insurance plan, and other information We learn about your health or
            vision through our provision of the Services. We may disclose this
            information so that doctors, nurses, other optical dispensers, and
            other entities like laboratories can meet your healthcare needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Payment. Payment includes billing, coverage, and claims activities.
            We document the Services that you receive when We provide care to
            you so that you (or, if applicable, your vision insurance plan or
            another third party) can pay Us for the Services. If applicable, We
            may share information with your vision insurance plan about upcoming
            treatment or Services that require prior approval by the plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Healthcare Operations. We use PHI to improve the Services and train
            staff, and for case management, care coordination, business
            management, quality improvement, performance evaluation, marketing
            activities permitted under HIPAA, customer service activities, and
            other internal business purposes.

        </ul>
        <p>
          Any other uses or disclosures not set forth in this Notice may only be
          performed with your written permission. Consistent with HIPAA, We will
          also obtain your written permission (also called an “authorization”)
          before We use or disclose your PHI for purposes which require an
          authorization, such as for certain types of marketing or sale of PHI.
          You may revoke your permission, in writing, at any time. If you do so,
          We will no longer use or disclose your PHI for the reasons covered by
          your written permission, but note that We are unable to take back any
          disclosures We have already made with your permission, and that We are
          required to retain Our records of the care that We’ve provided to you.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Our Responsibilities with Respect to your PHI</h3>
        <p>We're required by HIPAA to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintain the privacy and security of your PHI</li>
          <li>
            Provide this Notice setting forth Our legal duties and privacy
            practices regarding PHI
          </li>
          <li>
            Tell you if there has been a security breach that compromises the
            privacy or security of your PHI
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please note that some states have laws that may require that we apply
          extra protections to some of your health information.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Your HIPAA Rights with Respect to your PHI</h3>
        <p>
          You have the following rights with respect to your PHI maintained by
          Us.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Inspect and copy. You have the right to ask to inspect and copy
            certain portions of your PHI, whether electronic or in paper. We
            may, in certain limited circumstances, deny your request to inspect
            or copy your PHI. If We do so, We will inform you of the reason for
            the denial. We will provide a copy or a summary of your PHI, usually
            within 30 days of receiving your request. We may charge a reasonable
            fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            Amend. You have the right to ask Us to amend your PHI if you feel
            that it is incorrect or incomplete. We may, in certain limited
            circumstances, deny your request to amend your PHI. If We do so, we
            will tell you why in writing within 60 days and about your right to
            submit a statement of disagreement for inclusion in your records.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accounting of disclosures. You have the right to request a list (an
            accounting) of Our disclosures of your PHI made over the past six
            years, who We shared your PHI with, and why. This right does not
            apply to disclosures made for treatment, payment, or healthcare
            operations; disclosures made to you about your treatment;
            disclosures made pursuant to an authorization (disclosures you asked
            Us to make); and certain other disclosures. We’ll provide one
            accounting a year for free but will charge a reasonable cost-based
            fee if you ask for another one within 12 months.
          </li>
          <li>
            Restrictions on disclosure. You have the right to request
            restrictions on how We use or disclose your PHI for treatment,
            payment or Our operations. We’re not required to comply with such
            requests, and We may say “no” if it would affect your care. If you
            pay for a Service or health care item out of pocket in full, you can
            ask Us not to share that information for the purpose of payment or
            Our operations with your health insurer. We will say “yes” unless a
            law requires us to share that information, such as in certain
            emergency situations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Confidential Communication. You have the right to request that we
            communicate with you in a specific way, such as at a specific
            telephone number, or to send mail to a different address. We will
            say “yes” to all reasonable requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            Paper copy. You have the right to obtain a paper copy of this Notice
            at any time (even if you’re currently reading it electronically!).
            We will provide you with a paper copy promptly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose someone to act for you. If you have given someone medical
            power of attorney or if someone is your legal guardian, that person
            can exercise your HIPAA rights and make choices about your PHI. We
            will make sure the person has this authority and can act for you
            before We take any action.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. Changes to this Notice</h3>
        <p>
          We occasionally review this Notice to make sure it complies with
          applicable laws and conforms to changes in Our business. We may need
          to update this Notice, and we reserve the right to do so at any time.
          If We change the terms of this Notice, the new terms will apply to all
          PHI that We maintain about you, including PHI that was created or
          received before such changes were made. We will post the new Notice on
          Our websites and mobile applications, and will update the “Effective
          Date” at the top of this page so you can tell if it has changed since
          your last visit. We will make the new Notice available upon request.
          Your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of the
          terms of such revised Notice.
        </p>
