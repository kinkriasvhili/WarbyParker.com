          <h1>The whole story begins with you</h1>
          <p>
            Since day one, over 15 million pairs of glasses have been
            distributed through our Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program. Alleviating
            the problem of impaired vision is at the heart of what we do, and
            with your help, our impact continues to expand.

            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
              Approximately 1 billion people around the world need glasses but
              don’t have access to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              To help address this problem, we work with a handful of partners
              worldwide to ensure that for every pair of Warby Parker glasses
              purchased, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need.
              There are two models we employ:
            </p>
            <p>
              1) Empowering people to administer basic eye exams and sell
              glasses at ultra-affordable prices
            </p>
            <p>
              2) Directly giving vision care and glasses to those in need, via
              cross-sector partnerships

            <h3>Our Partners</h3>
            <p>
              The nonprofit social enterprise VisionSpring is our
              longest-standing partner in the Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program.
              VisionSpring creates access to affordable eyewear for those living
              on less than $4 per day, raising awareness about common optical
              issues, conducting vision screenings, and selling highly
              subsidized eyeglasses in low-income communities.They also train a
              range of health workers and mission-aligned organizations to do
              the same. Nearly 60% of VisionSpring customers are getting glasses
              for the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, we began our partnership with the LV Prasad Eye Institute
              (LVPEI) in Hyderabad, India. Much like our work with VisionSpring,
              we give LVPEI the monetary equivalent of a pair of glasses and
              they offer either affordable or free eye care to underserved
              people, who often live in remote communities across India.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2015, we created Pupils Project, a program that works with
              local organizations and government agencies across the United
              States to give free vision screenings, eye exams, and glasses to
              schoolchildren—for many of whom this is their first pair. This
              model helps eliminate barriers to access by providing free
              prescription glasses and meeting children at school, where
              teachers are often the first to spot vision issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also work with the organization Ver Bien Para Aprender Mejor,
              which uses a similar model to support students across Mexico. For
              24 years, the organization has visited around 10,000 schools per
              year, providing over 16 million eye exams and more than 6.2
              million eyeglasses to students throughout the country.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the past few years, we’ve also broadened our work with
              RestoringVision, a global nonprofit dedicated to creating
              equitable access to eye care and eyeglasses for individuals in
              poverty or extreme poverty. They have reached over 25 million
              people in 144+ countries over the past 19 years. Through our
              partnership with RestoringVision, we provide free glasses to those
              in global communities, including refugee camps and pre-emerging
              markets. This allows us to reach communities with different needs,
              access, and awareness around vision care—plus distribute reading
              glasses to even more geographical regions and markets than we’ve
              ever served before.
