        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h3>Effective Date: December 30, 2022</h3>
        <p>
          At Warby Parker, we’re all about helping you see things a little more
          clearly. And we believe that you have a right to know what information
          We collect from you. So we’ve created this Privacy Policy (“Policy”)
          to let you know what to expect when you interact with Warby Parker
          Inc., which does business as Warby Parker (“Warby Parker,” “We,” “Us,”
          or “Our”), and any of Our affiliates, including Eye Doctors (defined
          below) and their practices, such as Walnut Vision Care, to which We
          may provide certain administrative or management services
          (“Affiliates”). This Policy applies to your use of Our retail
          locations; any of Our websites, website features, and mobile
          applications (each, an “App”).
        </p>
        <p>
          We operate a mobile application and related website (the “Virtual
          Vision Test app”, formerly known as our Prescription Check app) and
          retail store service and related website (“In-Store Prescription
          Check” and, together with the Virtual Vision Test app, “Virtual Vision
          Test”) that you may use for the purpose of performing a vision test
          that may allow you to update your eyewear prescription. This Privacy
          Policy applies to your use of Virtual Vision Test. Collectively the
          retail locations, Our websites and Apps, Our Affiliates that display
          or contain a link to this Privacy Policy, and Virtual Vision Test are
          referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Services”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your use of Virtual Vision Test is subject to our Virtual Vision Test
          Terms of Use. Your use of all other Services is subject to our Terms
          of Use. Our use of any individually identifiable health information
          you provide is subject to the requirements of the Health Insurance
          Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). In addition to
          this Privacy Policy, our Notice of Privacy Practices will apply to
          such information.

          deidentified data, or information collected by third party websites
          (“Third Party Services”), such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest,

          Doctors”) who perform medical services at Our locations are

          (“Independent Practices”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to
          Independent Practices or to websites or mobile apps they operate.

        <h2>1. What Information Warby Parker Collects</h2>
        <p>
          We collect different types of information for Our business purposes
          from the following sources:
        </p>
        <p>
          Information you provide us. We collect information that you provide to
          Us through the Services and other communications. We may also collect
          information from entities you have requested or authorized to provide
          information to Us in connection with Our Services. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you create an account with Us, you provide your first and last
            name, email address, and password.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may provide Us with information when you use certain online
            features, such as Home Try-On or when you book an eye exam. This
            information may include (i) your first and last name; email address;
            phone number; home, physical, or shipping address; and date of
            birth; (ii) information about the products you try on and purchase;
            (iii) information about other people, such as when you direct Us to
            send a gift card; or (iv) any other identifiers that may permit the
            physical or online contacting of a specific person. To the extent
            the information you provide is related to your health care status,
            including the provision of or payment for health care services, such
            information will be considered Protected Health Information and
            covered by Our Notice of Privacy Practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you make a purchase, We may request information from you to
            facilitate the transaction and get you the goods you requested. We
            may ask you to provide payment information, which may include
            payment card information (such as credit card number, type, and
            expiration date), vision insurance plan information, billing
            address, and shipping address. We do not store any payment card
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may collect certain information from you when you apply for a job
            through Our Jobs page.
          </li>
          <li>For certain online, App, and in-store features, We may ask you to submit (or We may ask your permission to take) a photo, facial scan, or other image of you.
            <ul>
            <li>For example, when using the Virtual Try-On or Find Your Width features in our App, we use TrueDepth API technology with your camera to look at and measure multiple data points on your face. We use that information to place AR optical and sunglasses frames on your face in a realistic position and scale. We can also guide you to the best “width” frames based on your facial data points. We do not store any of these scans or measurements and we only collect and use that data while you are using the Virtual Try-On feature. We do not share these scans or measurements with any third parties.</li>
            <li>When using the Digital PD tool, we use your camera and face mesh and depth map data from the TrueDepth API technology to measure your facial features, including your pupillary distance (PD). Your PD is a needed measurement for your glasses prescription. Once we have a measurement, you can choose if you would like to update and store this measurement with your Warby Parker glasses prescription details. If you choose to add this data to your prescription, the PD measurement is added to your Warby Parker glasses prescription details and may be shared with third parties as a part of your prescription in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you choose not to add this data to your existing Warby Parker prescription, we do not store or share this data with any third parties.
            </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When you use Virtual Vision Test, you disclose certain information about yourself by (1) answering a series of questions to determine whether you are eligible to participate in Virtual Vision Test (the "Eligibility Questionnaire"), (2) performing a series of tasks to help licensed optometrists or ophthalmologists (each an "Eye Doctor") determine whether to issue you a renewed prescription (the "Vision Test"), (3) recording your audio responses to the Vision Test tasks, and (4) communicating with Warby Parker or our Eye Doctors in connection with your use of Virtual Vision Test. The In-Store Prescription Check Vision Test includes an acuity test and measurement of your refractive error using a handheld device, and the results of both will be provided to Us.
          <li>"Health Information" is information that relates to your past and present health or vision conditions (including medications, ailments, and prescriptions) that is derived from your use of Virtual Vision Test or MyVisionDirectory. Some Health Information may be subject to laws and regulations, including HIPAA. You represent that any Health Information that you disclose to us is your Health Information that you are authorized to disclose to us. "Personal Information" is information about you, including your first name, last name, and demographic information, derived from your use of Virtual Vision Test or MyVisionDirectory.

          <li>any other information that you submit to Us in connection with your Eligibility Questionnaire, Vision Test, Virtual Vision Test, or the Services, including information exchanged in emails, texts, chats, or calls between you and Warby Parker.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </li>
          <li>When you contact Us, We do everything possible to make sure you have an exceptional shopping experience. If you contact Us in person, by phone (calling or texting), email, instant message (including Facebook Messenger), live chat, through social media or Our App, or by some other means, We may keep a record of your contact information and the content of the communication for later reference.
