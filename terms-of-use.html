        <h1>Effective Date: September 11, 2023</h1>
        <h2>Virtual Vision Test Terms of Use</h2>
        <h3>1. Your Virtual Vision Test.</h3>
        <p>
          Warby Parker Inc. (“Warby Parker,” “we,” “us” or “our”) operates a
          mobile application and related website (the “Virtual Vision Test App”)
          and retail store service and related website (the “In-Store
          Prescription Check” and, collectively with the Virtual Vision Test
          App, “Virtual Vision Test”) that you may use for the purpose of
          performing a vision test that may allow you to renew your eyewear
          prescription. When you use Virtual Vision Test, you will provide us
          with certain information about yourself by (1) answering a series of
          questions (“Eligibility Questionnaire”) to determine whether you are
          eligible to participate in the Virtual Vision Test, (2) performing a
          series of tasks to help an Eye Doctor determine whether to issue you a
          renewed eyewear prescription (“Vision Test”), and/or (3) communicating
          with Warby Parker or an Eye Doctor in connection with your use of the
          Virtual Vision Test. Virtual Vision Test allows a licensed optometrist
          or ophthalmologist (each an “Eye Doctor”) to review your Eligibility
          Questionnaire, your Vision Test, and other information about you and
          provide you with certain telehealth services related to your vision
          (the “Services”). The In-Store Prescription Check Vision Test includes
          an acuity test and measurement of your refractive error using a
          handheld device. After reviewing your Eligibility Questionnaire, your
          Vision Test, and other information about you, one or more Eye Doctors,
          solely in their independent professional judgment, will determine
          whether to issue you a renewed prescription for corrective eyewear or,
          alternatively, to recommend that you receive a comprehensive eye exam.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’d like to speak with the Eye Doctor who reviewed the results of
          your Eligibility Questionnaire and Vision Test, please call us at
          888.492.7297 so that we can connect you with him or her. Upon your
          request, we can send a copy of your results to your primary care
          physician.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that currently Virtual Vision Test is available only to
          individuals in the United States between the ages of 18 and 65, and
          that we do not knowingly allow individuals under the age of 18 or
          above the age of 65 to access Virtual Vision Test. Virtual Vision Test
          may not be available in certain states. You may not access or use
          Virtual Vision Test or the Services in any jurisdiction where Virtual
          Vision Test or the Services would be unlawful.
        </p>
        <p>
          By accessing and using Virtual Vision Test, you agree to be bound by
          these Terms of Use and all other terms and policies. If you do not
          wish to be bound by any of these Terms of Use, you may not use Virtual
          Vision Test or the Services. Note that these Terms of Use should not
          be confused with Warby Parker’s general website’s Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that neither Virtual Vision Test nor the Services
          constitutes a comprehensive eye examination, or should be considered,
          or used as a substitute for, a comprehensive eye examination, and
          neither tests for abnormalities, diseases, or risk factors of disease.
          Virtual Vision Test is not a replacement for a comprehensive eye
          examination, and the Eye Doctors who provide you Services in
          connection with Virtual Vision Test are not intended to replace
          in-person medical care. It is recommended that you receive a
          comprehensive eye examination at intervals recommended by your doctor.
          You should seek emergency help or follow-up care when recommended by
          an Eye Doctor or when otherwise needed, and you should continue to
          consult with your primary care physician and other healthcare
          professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          THESE TERMS OF USE PROVIDE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND WARBY
          PARKER RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL
          BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO
          GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE,
          EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOUR
          RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR
          JURY, AND YOUR CLAIMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS ACTION. PLEASE
          REVIEW SECTION 17 (“DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION”) FOR THE
          DETAILS REGARDING YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ANY DISPUTES WITH WARBY
          PARKER.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Healthcare Services.</h3>
        <p>
          All Eye Doctors who deliver Services through Virtual Vision Test are
          independent professionals and are solely responsible for the eye care
          services provided to you. Warby Parker does not provide optometric or
          medical services through Virtual Vision Test and is not licensed to
          practice optometry or medicine. Instead, we contract with one or more
          professional corporations and/or licensed Eye Doctors to provide the
          Services to you. None of the content on Virtual Vision Test or
          communications you receive from Warby Parker should be considered
          medical or optometric advice. You acknowledge and agree that Warby
          Parker does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and
          provides only a technology platform and infrastructure for connecting
          individuals with independent third party Eye Doctors. You acknowledge
          and agree that the Eye Doctors are solely responsible for and will
          have complete authority, responsibility, supervision, and control over
          the provision of the medical services, including the updated
          prescriptions for eyeglasses.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Prescriptions.</h3>
        <p>
          If you receive an eyewear prescription as a result of using Virtual
          Vision Test and the Services, we will email you a copy of the
          prescription. We will also add the prescription information to your
          Warby Parker account. It is your right to use that prescription to
          purchase eyeglasses or contact lenses from anywhere you’d like. If the
          Eye Doctor determines that you are not eligible for a renewed eyewear
          prescription through Virtual Vision Test, we will then notify you by
          email and may include additional notes or recommendations from the Eye
          Doctor. A quick note: Emails you send to or receive from Warby Parker
          or an Eye Doctor are not encrypted, which means that they’re
          vulnerable to interception by third parties. By using Virtual Vision
          Test, you agree that Warby Parker may email you a copy of your
          prescription and that Warby Parker and, if applicable, an Eye Doctor
          may communicate with you over email.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Telehealth Informed Consent.</h3>
        <p>
          Virtual Vision Test and the Services constitute a form of telehealth,
          which involves the electronic transmission of information between
          patients and healthcare professionals who provide optometric and/or
          medical services to patients remotely. We believe that telehealth—and
          Virtual Vision Test specifically—has the potential to provide a number
          of benefits, such as more efficient vision testing and improved access
          to eye care and eyewear prescriptions, since Virtual Vision Test
          enables patients to consult Eye Doctors from distant and convenient
          locations. However, as with any healthcare services, there are
          potential risks associated with the use of telehealth. Delays in
          evaluation or treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of
          the electronic equipment or systems. In rare instances, security
          protocols could fail, causing unauthorized access to your Personal
          Information or Health Information. Additionally, limitations in the
          technology, lack of access to complete information (including medical
          records), and the remote nature of telehealth may limit an Eye
          Doctor’s ability to determine whether an updated eyeglass prescription
          should be issued. By accepting these Terms of Use, you acknowledge and
          agree that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You understand that neither Virtual Vision Test nor the Services is
            a comprehensive eye examination, or should be considered, or used as
            a substitute for, a comprehensive eye examination, and neither tests
            for abnormalities, diseases, or risk factors of disease.
          </li>
          <li>
            You understand that you may expect the anticipated benefits from the
            use of telehealth in your care, but that no results can be
            guaranteed or assured.
          </li>
          <li>
            You understand and agree to our
            <a href="private.html">Privacy Policy.</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            You understand that your Eye Doctor may, in his or her independent
            professional opinion, determine that you are not eligible for an
            updated eyewear prescription through Virtual Vision Test.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5. Your Information.</h3>
        <p>
          "Health Information" is information that relates to your past and
          present health or vision conditions (including medications, ailments,
          and prescriptions) that is derived from your use of Virtual Vision
          Test. “Personal Information” is information about you, including your
          first name, last name, and demographic information, derived from your

          Virtual Vision Test, you agree and confirm that all Health Information
          and Personal Information that you have provided to Warby Parker and/or
          Eye Doctors is truthful and accurate, including, without limitation,
          your answers to the Eligibility Questionnaire.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Privacy.</h3>
        <p>
          Our Virtual Vision Test
          <a href="private.html">Privacy Policy </a> describes the information
          that we gather from you when you use Virtual Vision Test and how we
          use and share that information.
        </p>
        <h3>7. Your Warby Parker Account.</h3>
        <p>
          A personal Warby Parker account is required to access the Virtual
          Vision Test App. If you have already created a Warby Parker account,
          you may access Virtual Vision Test by entering your username and
          password on the app’s sign-in screen. If you do not have a Warby
          Parker account, you may create one within the app. Please do not use
          anyone else’s Warby Parker account and do not share your Warby Parker
          account information with anyone else. You are solely responsible for
          keeping your Warby Parker account and Warby Parker account password
          secure and for any consequence resulting from your failure to do so.
          You should never publish, distribute, or post login information for
          your Warby Parker account. You do not need a Warby Parker account in
          order to use the In-Store Prescription Check, but you will need to
          provide your email address.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Payment.</h3>
        <p>
          You agree to pay all fees or charges related to Virtual Vision Test as
          posted at the time of your Vision Test. By entering your payment
          information, you authorize us and our third party payment processors
          to charge the amount due. Please note that you will be charged for
          your Vision Test only if an Eye Doctor issues you an eyewear
          prescription as a result of your Vision Test. Currently, we are not
          accepting any vision insurance for Virtual Vision Test, In-Store
          Prescription Check, the Vision Test, or the Services. Please check
          with your vision insurance provider to see whether the Services are
          reimbursable as an out-of-network benefit.
        </p>
        <h3>9. Language.</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, In-Store Prescription Check and Virtual Vision Test
          supports only the English language.

          restriction is impermissible under applicable law or applicable third
          party license, you may not (a) decompile, reverse engineer, or
          otherwise access or attempt to access the source code for Virtual

          Vision Test App or In-Store Prescription Check that we make available
          to you. If you are prohibited under applicable law from using Virtual
          Vision Test, you may not use it. In addition, you shall not (i)
          license, sublicense, sell, resell, transfer, assign, distribute, or

          make derivative works based upon Virtual Vision Test or related
          materials; (iii) design or build a product using similar ideas,
          features, functions, or graphics of Virtual Vision Test or copy any
          ideas, features, functions, or graphics of Virtual Vision Test; or
          (iv) launch an automated program or script, including, but not limited
          to, web spiders, web crawlers, web robots, web ants, web indexers,
          bots, viruses, or worms, or any program which may make multiple server
          requests per second, or unduly burdens or hinders the operation and/or

          No matter where you’re located, the laws of the State of New York will
          govern these Terms of Use and the relationship between you and Warby
          Parker, without regard to New York’s conflicts of laws rules. If any
          provisions of these Terms of Use are inconsistent with any applicable
          law, those provisions will be superseded and/or modified only to the
          extent such provisions are inconsistent. If a lawsuit or court
          proceeding is permitted under these Terms of Use, then the parties
          agree to submit to the federal or state courts in New York County, New
          York for exclusive jurisdiction for the purpose of litigating any
          dispute arising out of or related to your use of Virtual Vision Test
          or your breach of these Terms of Use.

        <h3>17. Dispute Resolution.</h3>
        <p>
          A. Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and
          Warby Parker in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and
          Warby Parker agree that every dispute arising out of or in connection
          with these Terms of Use or your use of Virtual Vision Test will be
          resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a
          lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a
          judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and
          may be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award
          the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to
          arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to
          any aspect of these Terms of Use or your use of Virtual Vision Test,
          whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or
          any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises
          during or after the termination of these Terms of Use. YOU UNDERSTAND
          AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND WARBY
          PARKER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE
          IN A CLASS ACTION. B. Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section
          16.A, nothing in these Terms of Use will be deemed to waive, preclude,
          or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an
          individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement
          action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that
          action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or
          (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property
          infringement claim. C. Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and
          Warby Parker will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and
          governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the
          Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively,
          “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as
          modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA.
          The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by
          calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Warby Parker. The
          arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to
          the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding
          arbitration agreement. D. Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek
          arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the
          other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature
          required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current
          physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). Warby Parker's
          address for Notice is: Warby Parker Inc., 233 Spring Street, 6th Floor
          East, New York, NY 10013, Attn: Legal Department. The Notice must: (a)
          describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set
          forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make
          good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties
          do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is
          received, you or Warby Parker may commence an arbitration proceeding.
          During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you
          or Warby Parker must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after
          the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the
          dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, we will
          pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the
          arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by
          Warby Parker in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s
          award; or (iii) $1,000. E. Fees. If you commence arbitration in
          accordance with these Terms of Use, we will reimburse you for your
          payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000,
          in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA
          Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be
          agreed upon in New York County, New York, but if the claim is for
          $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be
          conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
          arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or
          (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the
          county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds
          that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the
          Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by
          the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)),
          then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In
          that case, you agree to reimburse Warby Parker for all monies
          previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay
          under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration
          is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision
          sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
          the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make
          rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of
          fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request
          from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on
          the merits. F. No Class Actions. YOU AND WARBY PARKER AGREE THAT EACH
          MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
          CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
          OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Warby
          Parker agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
          one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
          representative or class proceeding. G. Modifications to this
          Arbitration Provision. If we make any future change to this
          arbitration provision, other than a change to our address for Notice,
          you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days
          of the change to our address for Notice within 30 days of the change,
          in which case your account with Warby Parker will be immediately
          terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately
          prior to the changes you rejected, will survive. H. Enforceability. If
          Section 16.F is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this
          Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this
          Section 16 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree
          that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15 will
          govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Use.
